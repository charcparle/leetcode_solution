""" 
A palindrome is a sequence of numbers or letters that is the same if read both forward and backward (i.e. abcba, abccba).

Given an array of letters as input, write an algorithm that returns the number of contiguous subsequence palindromes.

Example: [a, a, b, b, a] as input would return 8.  The possible palindromes are a, a, b, b, a, aa, bb, abba (you donâ€™t need to return this).
